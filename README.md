## how I am learning Elixir

I want to learn Elixir, but sometimes at the end of the day I'm not really intellectually up for reading 40 pages of Dave Thomas's (fantastic) book.

So I'm writing these exercises to give myself something to do when I while watching TV or something.

I remember when I was learning Ruby, I found Learn Ruby the Hard Way to be a helpful resource. Sometimes rote work is a good way to get familiar with a language.
